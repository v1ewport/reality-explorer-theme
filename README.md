# REALITY EXPLORER THEME

THIS WAS TESTED AND BUILT IN **MANJARO LINUX** and **AWESOMEWM**

I used:
- **CONKY** (Desktop widgets)
- **POLYBAR** (The bar)
- **AWESOMEWM** (Window Manager)
- **KITTY** (Terminal emulator)
- **TERMINESS NERD FONTS**

# INSTALLATION

Install the **POLYBAR THEME** from here:
  https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes

It runs with the command `~/.config/polybar/launch.sh --hack`

The conky dotfiles are a custom version of these:

Copy the .conky folder to your home folder

Copy all the files from the bin folder to /usr/bin and make them executable

Copy all the folders from the config folder to /home/youruser/.config/

Copy the Wallpapers to /home/youruser/Pictures/Wallpapers/

The AwesomeWM config file has the code to run polybar, conky and change the wallpapers for each workspace
