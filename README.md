# REALITY EXPLORER THEME

THIS WAS TESTED AND BUILT IN **MANJARO LINUX** and **AWESOMEWM**

I used:
- **CONKY** (Desktop widgets)
- **POLYBAR** (The bar)
- **AWESOMEWM** (DE)
- **KITTY** (Terminal emulator)
- **TERMINESS NERD FONTS**

# INSTALLATION

Install the **POLYBAR THEME** from here:
  `https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes`

It runs with the command `~/.config/polybar/launch.sh --hack`

The conky dotfiles are a custom version of these:
  `https://www.deviantart.com/laserbeam3/art/Conky-empowered-desktop-168092656
  
Copy the .conky folder to your home folder
Copy all the files from the bin folder to /usr/bin and make them executable
Copy all the folders from the config folder to /home/youruser/.config/
Copy the Wallpapers to /home/youruser/Pictures/Wallpapers/

The AwesomeWM config file has the code to run polybar, conky and change the wallpapers for each workspace
